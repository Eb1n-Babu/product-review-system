Product Review System üåü

Hey there! Welcome to the Product Review System, a beginner-friendly RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). I created this project with help from Grok (created by xAI), GitHub Copilot, and various API references to guide the development process. Whether you‚Äôre new to coding or want a clean project to show off, this one‚Äôs got an easy setup, organized code, and clear Postman testing instructions. Plus, it has a tidy Git commit history for smooth GitHub submission. Let‚Äôs dive in! üòÑ



What‚Äôs This Project About?

This API lets you manage products, post reviews, and handle user roles like a pro. Here‚Äôs the rundown:


# Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Code Editor**: Use Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any text editor of your choice.
- **Postman** (optional): For testing API endpoints, download from [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/downloads).
- A GitHub account for pushing the project to a repository.


Admins üëë can create, update, or delete products.

Regular users üë§ can browse products, leave one review per product (with a 1-5 star rating and feedback), and view their own reviews.

Everyone üåç (even without logging in) can check out products and their average ratings.

Security üîí uses token-based authentication to keep actions like posting reviews or managing products secure.



Cool Features



Products: Include name, description, price, and an auto-calculated average rating.

Reviews: Have a 1-5 star rating and feedback, with a rule to prevent multiple reviews per product by the same user.

User Roles: Supports admin and regular users via a simple profile system.

Data Goodies: Product listings show average ratings and review counts.

RESTful Design: Follows best practices with solid error handling and input validation.



The project is split into three Django apps (products, reviews, users) to keep things neat and modular.

Testing with Postman üß™

Let‚Äôs test the API with Postman! Download it from postman.com if you haven‚Äôt already. Below are the exact test cases you provided, set up for Postman with clear instructions.



Get a Token üîë  



Open Postman and click New > HTTP Request.  

Set Method: POST, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/.  

Go to Body tab, select raw, choose JSON, and paste:{

&nbsp;   "username": "your\_username",

&nbsp;   "password": "your\_password"

}





Hit Send. You‚Äôll get a 200 OK response like:{

&nbsp;   "token": "your\_token\_here"

}





Copy the token for authenticated requests (use it in the Authorization header).





Create a Product (Admin) üõç  



Create a new request.  

Set Method: POST, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/.  

Go to Headers tab and add:  

Authorization: Token your\_token\_here (replace your\_token\_here with the token from step 1)  

Content-Type: application/json





Go to Body tab, select raw, choose JSON, and paste:{

&nbsp;   "name": "Test Product",

&nbsp;   "description": "A test product",

&nbsp;   "price": 19.99

}





Hit Send. Expect 201 Created (success) or 403 Forbidden (if not an admin).





Submit a Review (Regular User) ‚≠ê  



Create a new request.  

Set Method: POST, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/<product\_id>/reviews/ (replace <product\_id> with a valid product ID, like 1).  

Go to Headers tab and add:  

Authorization: Token your\_token\_here (use the token from step 1)  

Content-Type: application/json





Go to Body tab, select raw, choose JSON, and paste:{

&nbsp;   "rating": 5,

&nbsp;   "feedback": "Great product!"

}





Hit Send. Expect 201 Created (success) or 400 Bad Request (if you‚Äôve already reviewed this product).





List Products (Public) üõç  



Create a new request.  

Set Method: GET, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/.  

No headers needed (it‚Äôs public!).  

Hit Send. Expect 200 OK with a list of products, including average\_rating and review\_count.





Manage Users in the Admin Panel üñ•  



Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in your browser.  

Log in with your superuser credentials.  

Add users (Users > Add user) and assign roles (User Profiles > Add user profile, set role to admin or regular).  

Tip: Create an admin user for product creation and a regular user for review testing.









Why It‚Äôs Awesome üåü



Product Management üõç: Admins can add, edit, or remove products via the API or admin panel. Everyone can browse products.  

Review System ‚≠ê: Authenticated users can leave one 1-5 star review per product with feedback. No duplicates allowed!  

User Roles üë•: Supports admin and regular users with token-based access.  

Smart Data üìä: Product listings show auto-calculated average ratings and review counts.  

Secure üîí: Uses tokens, role-based permissions, and input validation.  

Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è: Returns clear HTTP status codes (400 for bad data, 401 for not logged in, 403 for unauthorized).





A Few Things to Know üìù



Secret Key üîê: The SECRET\_KEY in settings.py is for development. For production, generate a new one with a Django secret key tool.  

CORS üåê: CORS\_ALLOW\_ALL\_ORIGINS = True is fine for testing but should be locked down to specific domains in production.  

Database üóÑ: Uses SQLite for simplicity. For a real app, consider PostgreSQL.  

User Setup üë§: Create users and roles via the admin panel. A signup feature could be a fun next step!  

Git History üìú: Every step is committed with clear messages, making it easy for reviewers to follow along.

Resources Used üìö: This project was built with guidance from Grok (created by xAI), GitHub Copilot, and various API references to ensure a robust and well-structured implementation.
